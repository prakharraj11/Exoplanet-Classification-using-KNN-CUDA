This project successfully implemented a custom K-Nearest Neighbors classifier for exoplanet identification from NASA's Kepler mission data. The key contributions of this work include:

1. Efficient KNN Implementation: By leveraging GPU parallelization, we achieved significant speedup in both the KNN classification and SMOTE balancing algorithms, making it feasible to process large astronomical datasets efficiently.
2. Effective Class Balancing: Our SMOTE implementation successfully addressed the class imbalance problem, resulting in a more balanced representation of confirmed exoplanets and false positives in the training data.
3. Comprehensive Preprocessing: The data preprocessing pipeline, including missing value imputation, outlier removal using Z-scores, and feature scaling, contributed to the overall effectiveness of the classification model.
4. Strong Performance Metrics: The model achieved high accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing genuine exoplanets from false positives.
The approach presented in this project has potential applications beyond exoplanet classification, particularly in astronomical data analysis, where large datasets and class imbalance are common challenges. Future work could explore extending this approach to multi-class classification problems, incorporating additional features from the Kepler dataset, or applying it to data from other exoplanet-hunting missions such as TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite).
In the end, we believe The Universe is a pretty big place and if it's just us, it seems like an awful waste of space. In the words of Carl Sagan himself "Somewhere Something incredible is waiting to be known" and being in a field like this We are on It.
